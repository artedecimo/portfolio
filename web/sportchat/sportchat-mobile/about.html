   <p>SportChat is an application where you can create an account and find your preferred sport topic and chat with others about it. When you create an account, you start building your own profile page, so you can chose your username, email, avatar, and gender.</p><br>
   <p>In you profile page, users can see the previous information. Once you start your own thread and/or replying to other people͛s threads, that information will also be automatically added to your profile page and available for others to see in which forum/topic you are the most active. People will be able to see links to the names of the threads that you either created or replied to, and the Forum icon to which the thread corresponds.</p><br>
   <p>The main page of the app will be where the forums are displayed. All forums will be the name of the sport, like Baseball. The forums will most likely be listed alphabetically. An image of the sport along with the name of the sport below it, will be shown.</p><br>
   <p>There are several threads in the app, but each thread has to be linked to its own forum. The user would then name the title of a thread when they create it. The name can be in the form of a question or a sentence. For example: When the user goes inside the forum ͚Baseball͛, they would see a thread with the title ͞What is your favorite Baseball team?͟; They can also see which user created that particular thread and how many views and replies it has. </p><br>
   <p>The posts can only be seen once the user enters the thread. This page will have the thread title to be displayed on the top, and the posts will be in order from oldest to newest. The post will include the avatar and username of the poster, and underneath, will have the message. Clicking on the username, will take you to the user͛s profile page. Each thread can have posts, but posts cannot have sub-posts.  Neither forums nor posts cannot be removed. </p><br>
