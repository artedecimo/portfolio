<p>Many Native American tribes (Iroquois, Dakota, Tequesta, you name it) have lived here <i>seemingly</i> since the
beginning of time. Sure, some artifacts are unearthed accidentally
by the casual hobbyist or amateur, but if they have real historical significance, then local or state officials may become involved.</p></div>
