<div class="body"><p>Not just any fisher, <i>Mel</i> Fisher, a Keys local who is popular with beachgoers nearby. He lives near a marina and he's constantly on the
lookout for whatever washes up on the beach.</p>
<p>During his weekly scuba dive, Mel discovered some rotting wood near a reef offshore. Inspecting it closely, he discovered similar pieces around the area. Searching along with
his friends they eventually came to an old ship.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disturb it more than needed, they took some pictures and showed it to other treasure afficionados. The fate of the wreck is yet to be determined.</p>
