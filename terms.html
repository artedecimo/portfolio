    <center><h2>Freelance Web Design Agreement</h2></center>
     <h3>Client/Freelancer Relationship</h3>
    <p>Freelancer is working as an <i>independent contractor</i> for client, not an <i>employee</i>. </p>
    <h3>Web Hosting</h3>
    <p>All web hosting and domain accounts have a separate third-party subscription with a domain/hosting provider. Client may choose to setup their own domain/hosting service, <i>or</i> Freelancer may setup domain and/or hosting for Client, which would then be billed as a maintenance fee. </p>
    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
    <p>The project timeline is determined by the client contributing to the workflow with prompt responses, as well as the Freelancer recieving content for the website in a timely manner. Any delays in approvals or responses from the Client will significantly affect the projected timeline, with the possibility of the original deadline being postponed. By agreeing to these terms, Client acknowledges their responsibility in keeping the project on-schedule. On the other hand, if the Freelancer is unable to meet project deadlines, the project timeline and subsequent payments will be adjusted accordingly.
</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Maintenance done <i>during</i> the project timeline will be billed at the completion of the project unless noted otherwise. Any payment for maintenance done <i>after</i> the completion of the project, will be due on a weekly basis at the standard hourly rate.</p>
<h3>Third-party services or subscriptions</h3>
<p>Invoices for subscriptions (ex: stock photography) and/or additional materials and services authorized for the project are due before said subscriptions/materials are purchased. Third-party Subscriptions/services will continue to be billed to Client on a recurring basis (if applicable) until termination of project, or until Client determines that subscription/service will no longer be used, whichever is sooner.
</p>
<h3>Custom Assets</h3>
<p>At the request of Client, Freelancer may create custom graphics including but not limited to (animated GIFS, graphics, etc). Payment for these customized assets are due before assets are created.
</p>
<h3>Ownership</h3>
<p>Freelancer retains ownership of all custom assets, custom web templates ("original content") created for Client by Freelancer. Upon completion of project and final payment, Client will be given a license to use and display the ("original content") with no attribution required.
</p>
<h3>Browser-Compatibility</h3>
<p>The Web browsers accounted for are the most recent versions of: Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer.
</p>
<h3>E-Commerce Laws</h3>
<p>Client is solely responsible for complying with appropriate laws or taxes relating to their use of an e-commerce website. Freelancer is not responsible for any costs, fees, suits, claims, penalties or otherwise, related to Client's use of their e-commerce website.
</p>
<h3>Invoices</h3>
<p>All invoices are due as soon as they are recieved. If Freelancer doesn't recieve payment within 7 days of the invoice date and no reasonable written notice is provided by Client, it will be assumed that the Client terminated the project.
</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>Client or Freelancer may terminate this agreement at anytime by giving prior written notice to the other party. If Client terminates this agreement, all prior work done by Freelancer up until the termination date will be billed to Client. Consequently, Freelancer will no longer be responsible for providing additional services to Client.
</p>
<p>If the agreement is terminated because of Freelancer's inability to complete the project, the amount of a refund given to Client shall be determined based on hours spent and/or how close the project was to completion.
</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Ideally we <i>all</i> want things to work out perfectly, but if there are any questions or concerns, please contact me so that we can work something out.
</p>

<p>Thanks for choosing me to be your Freelancer!</p>
