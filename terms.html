<body id="terms">
    <h2 class="text-center">Web Design Agreement</h2>
<h3 class="text-center">Client/Web Designer Relationship</h3>
    <p><span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> is working as an <i>independent contractor</i> for <span class="bold-terms">Client</span>, not an <i>employee</i>. </p><h3>Web Hosting</h3>
    <p>All web hosting and domain accounts have a separate third-party subscription with a domain/hosting provider. <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> may choose to setup their own domain/hosting service, <i>or</i> <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> may setup domain and/or hosting for <span class="bold-terms">Client</span>, which would then be billed as a maintenance expense. </p>
    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
    <p>The project timeline is determined by the <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> contributing to the workflow with prompt responses, as well as the <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> receiving content for the website in a timely manner. Any delays in approvals or responses from the <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> will significantly affect the projected timeline, with the possibility of the original deadline being postponed. By agreeing to these terms, <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> acknowledges their responsibility in keeping the project on-schedule. On the other hand, if the <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> is unable to meet project deadlines, the project timeline and subsequent payments will be adjusted accordingly.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Maintenance</h3>
<p>Maintenance done <i>during</i> the project timeline will be billed at the completion of the project unless noted otherwise. Any payment for maintenance done <i>after</i> the completion of the project, will be due on a weekly basis at the standard hourly rate.</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Third-party services or subscriptions</h3>
    <p>Invoices for subscriptions <i>(ex: stock photography)</i> and/or additional materials and services authorized by <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> for the project are due before said subscriptions/materials are purchased. Third-party Subscriptions/services will continue to be billed to <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> on a recurring basis (if applicable) until termination of project, or until <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> determines that subscription/service will be canceled, whichever is sooner.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Custom Assets</h3>
    <p>At the request of <span class="bold-terms">Client</span>, <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> may create custom graphics including but not limited to <i>(animated GIFS, graphics, etc)</i>. Payment for these customized assets are due before assets are created.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Ownership</h3>
    <p><span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> retains ownership of all custom assets, custom web templates, and all other ("original content") created for <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> by <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span>. Upon completion of project and final payment, <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> will be given a license to use and display the ("original content") with no attribution required.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Browser-Compatibility<br>
<i class="fa fa-firefox" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="fa fa-safari" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="fa fa-chrome" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="fa fa-internet-explorer" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</h3>
<p>The Web browsers accounted for are the most recent versions of: 
Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">E-Commerce Laws</h3>
    <p><span class="bold-terms">Client</span> is solely responsible for complying with appropriate laws or taxes relating to their use of an e-commerce website. <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> is not responsible for any costs, fees, suits, claims, penalties or otherwise, related to <span class="bold-terms">Client's</span> use of their e-commerce website.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Payments</h3>
<p>Work will begin once the 1st payment is recieved. Payments will <i>only</i> be processed thru Paypal. Even if you do not have a Paypal account, you will have the option to pay with credit or debit card thru Paypal at checkout.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Invoices</h3>
<p>All invoices are due as soon as they are recieved. If <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> doesn't recieve payment within 7 days of the invoice date, it will be assumed, at <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer's</span> own discretion, that the Client terminated the project.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Termination</h3>
    <p><span class="bold-terms">Client</span> or <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> may terminate this agreement at anytime by giving prior written notice (by email) to the other party. If <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> terminates this agreement, all prior work done by <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> up until the termination date will be billed to <span class="bold-terms">Client</span>. Once Agreement is terminated, <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer</span> will no longer be responsible for providing additional services to <span class="bold-terms">Client</span>.
</p>
    <p>If the agreement is terminated because of <span class="bold-terms">Web Designer's</span> inability to complete the project, the amount of a refund given to <span class="bold-terms">Client</span> shall be determined based on hours spent and/or how close the project was to completion.
</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Severability</h3>
<p>If any term of this Agreement is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or incapable of being enforced, such term shall be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; all other terms hereof shall remain 
in full force and effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable term shall be deemed replaced by a term that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable term.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Questions</h3>
<p>Ideally we <i>all</i> want things to work out perfectly, but if there are any questions or concerns, please send a message so that we can figure something out.
</p>

<p>Thanks for your cooperation!</p>
